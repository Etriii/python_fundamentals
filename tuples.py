mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.

# Tuple Items
# Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# Ordered
# When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# Unchangeable
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

# Example
# Tuples allow duplicate values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# Acess tuples. same as list


# Unpacked Tuples
# If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:

# Example
# Assign the rest of the values as a list called "red":

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

# Join tuples are the same as joining lists
